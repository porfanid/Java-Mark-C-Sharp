# Java-Mark

## Deprecated
This app is no longer maintained as I have developed a new web application, so that it can be cross-platform. The app currently is working, but it may show several warnings with the dependencies. The current version can be found [here](http://cse.uoi.gr/~cse74134/java.html) which is a simple html file and a lot of javascript to perform the calculations.

## Description

This is an app to check the mark in java

The executable is in here:
